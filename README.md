# Python Data Structures
Data structures in Python are a way of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. Python provides built-in and standard libraries that offer a variety of data structures to cater to different needs.

# 1. Lists
Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python. They are mutable and can store a collection of items.
python
      my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]

# 2. Tuples
Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable. Once created, the elements of a tuple cannot be changed.

python
        my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# 3. Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for tasks like eliminating duplicate entries.

python
      my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# 4. Dictionaries
Dictionaries are key-value pairs, providing a way to store and retrieve data using a unique key.

python
      my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

# 5. Arrays
Arrays in Python are provided by the array module. They are similar to lists but are more efficient for certain operations.

python
from array import array
      my_array = array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
